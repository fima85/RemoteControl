# RemoteControl
This application allows the user to control an electric whell chair via bluetooth.

Included, you can find the 3D model for the joystick adapter and instructions on how to print it and the schematic for the electronic circuit (and a shopping list!).
Our original usecase was for a disabled young man, who wanted to be able to send his chair away from his bed when visitors came, and call it back once they left.

Turns out that when life takes some independence from you, the best think you can do for someone, is give it back to him.

If YOU build it, it WILL come!
